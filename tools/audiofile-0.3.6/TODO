Audio File Library
To Do List

Michael Pruett <michael@68k.org>

Short-term
----------

Handle more compressed data formats, most importantly Ogg Vorbis.
GSM 06.10 would also be nice.

Handle sample rate conversion.

More comprehensive tests should be developed to stress-test the
library.  Tests are needed most for the following sets of functions:
	* af{Get,Set}VirtualChannels/afSetChannelMatrix
	* afGetSampleFormat/af{Get,Set}VirtualSampleFormat
	* af{Get,Set}Loop{IDs,Mode,Count,Start,End,StartFrame,EndFrame,Track}

Support for auxiliary data in IRCAM files (maximum amplitude, comments,
etc.) should be added.

Long-term
---------

It would be nice to support some more file formats.

Add locale support for error messages.

Whenever a compression format is requested, the library should scan
through /usr/lib/audiofile/*.so to see if any DSOs support the requested
format.
