# sm64ex-coop
Online cooperative multiplayer mod for SM64, aiming to synchronize all entities and every level for two players.
Fork of [sm64pc/sm64ex](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex).

## Goal
Create a mod for the PC port where two people can play online together peer-to-peer.
Unlike previous online attempts, this one will synchronize enemies and events such that you will be interacting with the same world at the same time.

## Building
For building instructions, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/wiki).
