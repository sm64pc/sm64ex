# sm64pc
OpenGL adaptation of [n64decomp/sm64](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64). 

Feel free to report bugs and contribute, but remember, there must be **no upload of any copyrighted asset**. 
Run `./extract_assets.py --clean && make clean` or `make distclean` to remove ROM-originated content. This port has been made possible mostly thanks to [Emill](https://github.com/Emill) and his [n64-fast3d-engine](https://github.com/Emill/n64-fast3d-engine/) renderer.


Please contribute **first** to the [nightly branch](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64pc/tree/nightly/). New functionality will be merged to master once they're considered to be well-tested.

## Features

 * Native rendering. You can now play SM64 without the need of an emulator. 
 * Variable aspect ratio and resolution. The game can now correctly render at basically any window size.
 * Native xinput controller support. On Linux, DualShock 4 has been confirmed to work plug-and-play.
 * Analog camera control and mouse look. (Activate with `make BETTERCAMERA=1`.)
 * An option to disable drawing distances. (Activate with `make NODRAWINGDISTANCE=1`.)
 * Model and texture fixes. (Activate with `make TEXTURE_FIX=1`.)
 * In-game control binding.
 * Skip introductory Peach & Lakitu cutscenes with the `--skip-intro` CLI option
 * Disabling the HUD.
 * Cheats menu in Options. (Activate with `--cheats`) Please note that if a cheat asks you to press "L" it's referring to the N64 button. Check your bindings and make sure you have the "L" button mapped to a button in your controller.
 * Text-based save support. (Activate with `make TEXTSAVES=1`.)
